            <h1 class="zwei">BLACK YOUTH IN A WHITE MANS WORLD</h1>
            <section class="inhalt">
            <p>
                „Black Youth in a white men’s world“ tells the story of young BiPOC ́s coming of age in a Western world shaped
                by white heteronormative people and structures. A coming of age that is marked by racism, sadness, anger, 
                hatred, resulting violence, exclusion and the confrontation with one’s own identity.</p>

                <p>
                    Growing up I soon realized that innocence is reserved for only few of us.<br>
                    <br>
                    With black skin you have to accept, that this concept does not apply for you.<br>
                    <br>
                    For a few years the world will at least give you a slight taste of it since you are not yet perceived as a threat by your white surroundings. But this glimpse will get taken from you as soon as you enter the age of a teenager. 
                    When this white world you grew up in, in wich you had a slight faith that it will treat you good shows it’s true face.<br>
                    <br>
                    With black skin you have to accept that your coming of age wont be of the same lightness as the one of your peers. That there are things they can do but you can not.<br> 
                    <br>
                    Countless times you will feel fear and anger. Fear for your life and anger, because there is nothing that you can do to take revenge for the countless times they’ve turned a good night into a nightmare, denied you access, harmed you or killed your brothers.<br> 
                    Your anger will eventually make space for deep sadness. And when this sadness turns into pain, the anger and hate will come back. 
                    It will become an underlying fundament of your personality and your heart will become cold since this white world has so little for you and fears your existence so much.<br>
                    <br>
                    Love I experience like a verdant infant only to realize soon that even here I was not truly safe and free. 
                    <br><br>
                    With black skin you have to accept that your relations will be tested over and over again because 
                    Black Love is a fragil construct that needs to withstand so many aggressions.
                    And so is your sexuality<br>
                    <br>
                    With black skin pop culture will fetishize your body.  
                    You will become a sex trophy in the western eye.<br>
                    <br>
                    Countless times you will scrutinize the true Intensions of your white partners. 
                    If they are with you because of who you are or just to satisfy a fetish. 
                    Your body will be desired on one hand and feared on the other since they see your sexuality as a danger to their peace.<br>
                    <br>

                    Like my peers I had to finde my place in this world eventually.<br>
                    <br>
                    But with black skin doing so is much harder, since you grew up in this world that was never designed for you to have a place in it.<br>
                    <br>

                    It’s a white mans world you´re growing up in.<br>
                    A system that is unable to acknowledge your true beauty, your skill, your magic — since doing so would let it collapse and show all its cruelty.<br> 
                    It will therefor threaten your existence and joy again and again as it is the only way it can stay alive.<br>
                    <br>

                    It’s a white mans world you were born in.<br> 
                    But that doesn’t mean that you have to play by their rules — since they were never made for you to win.<br>
                    <br>
                    So break free. </p>
